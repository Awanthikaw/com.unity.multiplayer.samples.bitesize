# API Diorama

This is a sample project that provides a series of scenes. Each scene aims at explaining a specific API or system commonly used in Netcode for GameObjects. In this sample you will learn more about client-server communication, state synchronization, and other typical mechanics of multiplayer games.

## Sample feature

Making a multiplayer game is different than making a singleplayer one. Understanding how to send data and events over the network and to the right players is a challenge.
API Diorama's aim is to show you how to perform common actions in a server-authoritative multiplayer environment, so that you can build the features of your game with them in mind.
